One of the main strengths of the Java programming language is its portability and compatibility across different platforms and devices. Java programs can run on any machine that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, which is a software layer that interprets and executes the Java bytecode. The JVM also ensures that Java programs adhere to a set of rules and conventions that make them secure and reliable. The book explains how the JVM works and how it interacts with the underlying operating system and hardware.
 
Another key feature of the Java programming language is its support for object-oriented programming (OOP), which is a paradigm that organizes data and behavior into reusable and modular units called objects. Objects can communicate with each other through well-defined interfaces, which specify the methods that an object can invoke or provide. Objects can also inherit attributes and behaviors from other objects, forming a hierarchy of classes that share common characteristics. The book covers the fundamental concepts and principles of OOP, such as encapsulation, abstraction, polymorphism, inheritance, interfaces, abstract classes, inner classes, and nested classes.
 
The Java programming language also offers many built-in libraries and frameworks that provide useful functionality for common tasks and problems. For example, the java.util package contains classes and interfaces for collections, maps, iterators, comparators, random numbers, dates, times, calendars, locales, formatting, scanning, sorting, searching, and more. The java.io package provides classes and interfaces for input/output operations, such as reading and writing files, streams, buffers, channels, sockets, serialization, compression, encryption, and more. The book covers most of these classes and interfaces in detail, with examples of how to use them effectively.
